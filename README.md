# Flower-Classification-TransferLeaning

Images of 5 varieties of flowers was provided to build a model to classify them.
The 5 varieties of flowers are daisy, sunflower, dandelion, rose and tulip. About 600 (plus) images for each of them was provided.

First a CNN model was built from scratch which yielded an overal accurracy of approximately 62%.
However, the accuracy was possible to be bumped up to more than 83% when pre-trained models like VGG and Resnet were leveraged.
This demonstrated the importance and need ot Transfer Learning.
